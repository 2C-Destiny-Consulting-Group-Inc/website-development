## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- Created organized directory structure with 6 categories
- Moved 4 existing PNG images to images/general/
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - IMAGE-INVENTORY.md (complete catalog)
  - IMAGES-USAGE-GUIDE.md (usage instructions)
  - IMAGE-REQUEST-TEMPLATE.md (request template)
- Added README files to all subdirectories
- Updated main README.md with image information

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Categorize existing images**: The 4 images in `images/general/` need to be:
   - Reviewed to determine their content
   - Renamed with descriptive names
   - Moved to appropriate category folders

2. **Add missing images**: Upload images that are referenced in HTML but missing:
   - Team member headshots (4 needed)
   - Hero images for various pages
   - Program and pillar images
   - Company logos

3. **Update HTML references**: Once images are properly organized:
   - Update paths in HTML files
   - Add proper responsive image attributes
   - Ensure alt text is descriptive
